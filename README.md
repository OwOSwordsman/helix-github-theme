# Helix GitHub Theme Generator
A program to generate all the GitHub theme variants for the helix editor. The dark and light variants were designed to match the corresponding VSCode version as closely as possible. The other variants were generated using the two templates.

Pre-generated themes are available in the `dist` folder.
